 * SMB: query_information_disk
 *
 * The SMB_COM_QUERY_INFORMATION_DISK command is used to determine the
 * capacity and remaining free space on the drive hosting the directory
 * structure indicated by Tid in the SMB header.
 *
 * Client Request                     Description
 * ================================== =================================
 *
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 0
 * USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * Server Response                    Description
 * ================================== =================================
 *
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 5
 * USHORT TotalUnits;                 Total allocation units per server
 * USHORT BlocksPerUnit;              Blocks per allocation unit
 * USHORT BlockSize;                  Block size (in bytes)
 * USHORT FreeUnits;                  Number of free units
 * USHORT Reserved;                   Reserved (client should ignore)
 * USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * The blocking/allocation units used in this response may be independent
 * of the actual physical or logical blocking/allocation algorithm(s) used
 * internally by the server.  However, they must accurately reflect the
 * amount of space on the server.
 *
 * This SMB only returns 16 bits of information for each field, which may
 * not be large enough for some disk systems.  In particular TotalUnits is
 * commonly > 64K.  Fortunately, it turns out the all the client cares
 * about is the total disk size, in bytes, and the free space, in bytes.
 * So,  it is reasonable for a server to adjust the relative values of
 * BlocksPerUnit and BlockSize to accommodate.  If after all adjustment,
 * the numbers are still too high, the largest possible values for
 * TotalUnit or FreeUnits (i.e. 0xFFFF) should be returned.
