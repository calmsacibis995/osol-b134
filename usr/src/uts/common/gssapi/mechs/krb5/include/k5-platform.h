/* Initialization and finalization function support for libraries.

   At top level, before the functions are defined or even declared:
   MAKE_INIT_FUNCTION(init_fn);
   MAKE_FINI_FUNCTION(fini_fn);
   Then:
   int init_fn(void) { ... }
   void fini_fn(void) { if (INITIALIZER_RAN(init_fn)) ... }
   In code, in the same file:
   err = CALL_INIT_FUNCTION(init_fn);

   To trigger or verify the initializer invocation from another file,
   a helper function must be created.

   This model handles both the load-time execution (Windows) and
   delayed execution (pthread_once) approaches, and should be able to
   guarantee in both cases that the init function is run once, in one
   thread, before other stuff in the library is done; furthermore, the
   finalization code should only run if the initialization code did.
   (Maybe I could've made the "if INITIALIZER_RAN" test implicit, via
   another function hidden in macros, but this is hairy enough
   already.)

   The init_fn and fini_fn names should be chosen such that any
   exported names staring with those names, and optionally followed by
   additional characters, fits in with any namespace constraints on
   the library in question.


   There's also PROGRAM_EXITING() currently always defined as zero.
   If there's some trivial way to find out if the fini function is
   being called because the program that the library is linked into is
   exiting, we can just skip all the work because the resources are
   about to be freed up anyways.  Generally this is likely to be the
   same as distinguishing whether the library was loaded dynamically
   while the program was running, or loaded as part of program
   startup.  On most platforms, I don't think we can distinguish these
   cases easily, and it's probably not worth expending any significant
   effort.  (Note in particular that atexit() won't do, because if the
   library is explicitly loaded and unloaded, it would have to be able
   to deregister the atexit callback function.  Also, the system limit
   on atexit callbacks may be small.)


   Implementation outline:

   Windows: MAKE_FINI_FUNCTION creates a symbol with a magic name that
   is sought at library build time, and code is added to invoke the
   function when the library is unloaded.  MAKE_INIT_FUNCTION does
   likewise, but the function is invoked when the library is loaded,
   and an extra variable is declared to hold an error code and a "yes
   the initializer ran" flag.  CALL_INIT_FUNCTION blows up if the flag
   isn't set, otherwise returns the error code.

   UNIX: MAKE_INIT_FUNCTION creates and initializes a variable with a
   name derived from the function name, containing a k5_once_t
   (pthread_once_t or int), an error code, and a pointer to the
   function.  The function itself is declared static, but the
   associated variable has external linkage.  CALL_INIT_FUNCTION
   ensures thath the function is called exactly once (pthread_once or
   just check the flag) and returns the stored error code (or the
   pthread_once error).

   (That's the basic idea.  With some debugging assert() calls and
   such, it's a bit more complicated.  And we also need to handle
   doing the pthread test at run time on systems where that works, so
   we use the k5_once_t stuff instead.)

   UNIX, with compiler support: MAKE_FINI_FUNCTION declares the
   function as a destructor, and the run time linker support or
   whatever will cause it to be invoked when the library is unloaded,
   the program ends, etc.

   UNIX, with linker support: MAKE_FINI_FUNCTION creates a symbol with
   a magic name that is sought at library build time, and linker
   options are used to mark it as a finalization function for the
   library.  The symbol must be exported.

   UNIX, no library finalization support: The finalization function
   never runs, and we leak memory.  Tough.

   DELAY_INITIALIZER will be defined by the configure script if we
   want to use k5_once instead of load-time initialization.  That'll
   be the preferred method on most systems except Windows, where we
   have to initialize some mutexes.




   For maximum flexibility in defining the macros, the function name
   parameter should be a simple name, not even a macro defined as
   another name.  The function should have a unique name, and should
   conform to whatever namespace is used by the library in question.
   (We do have export lists, but (1) they're not used for all
   platforms, and (2) they're not used for static libraries.)

   If the macro expansion needs the function to have been declared, it
   must include a declaration.  If it is not necessary for the symbol
   name to be exported from the object file, the macro should declare
   it as "static".  Hence the signature must exactly match "void
   foo(void)".  (ANSI C allows a static declaration followed by a
   non-static one; the result is internal linkage.)  The macro
   expansion has to come before the function, because gcc apparently
   won't act on "__attribute__((constructor))" if it comes after the
   function definition.

   This is going to be compiler- and environment-specific, and may
   require some support at library build time, and/or "asm"
   statements.  But through macro expansion and auxiliary functions,
   we should be able to handle most things except #pragma.

   It's okay for this code to require that the library be built
   with the same compiler and compiler options throughout, but
   we shouldn't require that the library and application use the
   same compiler.

   For static libraries, we don't really care about cleanup too much,
   since it's all memory handling and mutex allocation which will all
   be cleaned up when the program exits.  Thus, it's okay if gcc-built
   static libraries don't play nicely with cc-built executables when
   it comes to static constructors, just as long as it doesn't cause
   linking to fail.

   For dynamic libraries on UNIX, we'll use pthread_once-type support
   to do delayed initialization, so if finalization can't be made to
   work, we'll only have memory leaks in a load/use/unload cycle.  If
   anyone (like, say, the OS vendor) complains about this, they can
   tell us how to get a shared library finalization function invoked
   automatically.

   Currently there's --disable-delayed-initialization for preventing
   the initialization from being delayed on UNIX, but that's mainly
   just for testing the linker options for initialization, and will
   probably be removed at some point.  */
