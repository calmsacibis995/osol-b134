# As a pHCI driver, pmcs must specify the vHCI class it belongs to (scsi_vhci).
#
ddi-vhci-class="scsi_vhci";

#
# By default, MPxIO will be enabled on all pmcs controllers. To disable MPxIO
# for all pmcs controllers, set:
#
#mpxio-disable="yes";

#
# You can disable MPxIO on a per-HBA basis. Per port settings override the
# global setting for the specified ports. To disable MPxIO for the controller
# whose unit-address is 0 and whose parent is /pci@0/pci10de,5d@e, set:
#
#name="pmcs" parent="/pci@0/pci10de,5d@e" unit-address="0" mpxio-disable="yes";

#
# Global debug settings may be set using the 'pmcs-debug-mask' property.
# Any combination of values may be set according to the following:
#
# 0x0001 - Basic info; shouldn't print anything during normal operation
# 0x0002 - Small amount of I/O information during normal operation
# 0x0004 - Much more info during I/O; will impact performance
# 0x0008 - Very verbose at all times; definitely a performance impact
# 0x0010 - Debug information with regard to discovery/configuration
# 0x0020 - Debug information with regard to iport
# 0x0040 - Debug information with regard to map
# 0x0080 - Report on SCSI underruns and residuals
# 0x0100 - Report SCSI status for every command
# 0x0200 - PHY lock/unlock debug (very noisy)
# 0x0400 - Debug information with regard to device state
