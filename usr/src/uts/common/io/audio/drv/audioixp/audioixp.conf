#
# play-interrupts sets the number of interrupts per second when playing.
# This affects the resolution of various things, such as sample counts.
# record-interrupts does the same for record interrupts.
#
# These may be tuned to get more accurate information by increasing the
# count. However, the larger the interrupts per second the larger the
# load on the system. So use this capability cautiously. The audioixp
# driver enforces a maximum and minimum count.
#
# It should also be understood that not all interrupt rates are legal.
# The hardware is restricted to DMA buffers being allocated on certain
# boundaries. If those boundaries are violated the driver will not be
# loaded and an error message is entered into the messages log
