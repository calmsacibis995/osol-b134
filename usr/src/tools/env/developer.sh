#	Configuration variables for the runtime environment of the nightly
# build script and other tools for construction and packaging of releases.
# This script is sourced by 'nightly' and 'bldenv' to set up the environment
# for the build. This example is suitable for building a developers workspace,
# which will contain the resulting packages and archives. It is based off
# the onnv release. It sets NIGHTLY_OPTIONS to make nightly do:
#	creates cpio archives for bfu (-a)
#	runs 'make check' (-C)
#	DEBUG and non-DEBUG builds (-D)
#	runs lint in usr/src (-l plus the LINTDIRS variable)
#	sends mail on completion (-m and the MAILTO variable)
#	creates packages for PIT/RE (-p)
#	checks for changes in ELF runpaths (-r)
#

# over ssh or http.
