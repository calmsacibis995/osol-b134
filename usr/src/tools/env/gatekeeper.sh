#	Configuration variables for the runtime environment of the nightly
# build script and other tools for construction and packaging of releases.
# This script is sourced by 'nightly' and 'bldenv' to set up the environment
# for the build. This example is suitable for building a gate, 
# which will contain the resulting packages and archives (builds of the gate
# are done in children and then the resulting archives, packages, and proto
# area are put into the parent for everyone to use). It is based off
# the onnv release. It sets NIGHTLY_OPTIONS to make nightly do:
#	DEBUG and non-DEBUG builds (-D)
#	creates a globalization package (-0)
#	creates cpio archives for bfu (-a)
#	creates packages for PIT/RE (-p)
#	checks for new interfaces in libraries (-A)
#	runs 'make check' (-C)
#	runs lint in usr/src (-l plus the LINTDIRS variable)
#	sends mail on completion (-m and the MAILTO variable)
#	updates the protolist in the parent for children to compare with (-u)
#	updates the proto area in the parent when done (-U)
#	checks for changes in ELF runpaths (-r)
#	checks for changes in unreferenced files (-f)
#

# there is only one definition here, which assumes all the gate build machines
# (sparc and x86) are set up the same. But remember, this is a script, so
# you _could_ look at $MACH or `uname -n` and set these variables differently.
