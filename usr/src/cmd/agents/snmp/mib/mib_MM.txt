   -- MTAs typically group inbound reception, queue storage, and
   -- outbound transmission in some way. In the most extreme case
   -- information will be maintained for each different entity that
   -- receives messages and for each entity the MTA stores messages for
   -- and delivers messages to.  Other MTAs may elect to treat all
   -- reception equally, all queue storage equally, all deliveries
   -- equally, or some combination of this.

   -- In any case, a grouping abstraction is an extremely useful for
   -- breaking down the activities of an MTA. For purposes of labelling
   -- this will be called a "group" in this MIB.

   -- Each group contains all the variables needed to monitor all aspects
   -- of an MTA's operation.  However, the fact that all groups contain
   -- all possible variables does not imply that all groups must use all
   -- possible variables. For example, a single group might be used to
   -- monitor only one kind of event (inbound processing, outbound
   -- processing, or storage). In this sort of configuration all unused
   -- counters would be inaccessible; e.g., returning either a
   -- noSuchName error (for an SNMPv1 get), or a noSuchInstance
   -- exception (for an SNMPv2 get).

   -- Groups are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A given event may
   -- be recorded by more than one group, a message may be seen as
   -- stored by more than one group, and so on.  Groups should be all
   -- inclusive, however: if groups are implemented all aspects of an
   -- MTA's operation should be registered in at least one group. This
   -- freedom lets implementors use different sets of groups to
   -- provide differents "views" of an MTA.

   -- The possibility of overlap between groups means that summing
   -- variables across groups may not produce values equal to those in
   -- the mtaTable. mtaTable should always provide accurate information
   -- about the MTA as a whole.

   -- The term "channel" is often used in MTA implementations; channels
   -- are usually, but not always, equivalent to a group. However,
   -- this MIB does not use the term "channel" because there is no
   -- requirement that an MTA supporting this MIB has to map its
   -- "channel" abstraction one-to-one onto the MIB's group abstration.
