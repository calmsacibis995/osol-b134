#	The configuration file of the SNMP Relay for snmpdemod
#	

# IMPORTANT:
# ----------
#	So that the SNMP Relay will take into account
#	your configuration file, you must:
#	- rename this file with the ".snmprelay" extension
#	  (for example: myagent.snmprelay)
#	- check that this file is located in the configuration directory
#	  for the SNMP Relay (by default: /opt/SUNWconn/snmprelay)


##########
# macros # 
##########

# The following 3 macros are predefined:
#
#	mib-2 =		1.3.6.1.2.1
#	enterprise =	1.3.6.1.4.1
#	sun =		1.3.6.1.4.1.42
#
# Your can define your own macros, so that you can
# manipulate strings instead of OIDs in defining the agent.
# See the "agent" section below.

macros = {
	demo =	sun.1000

##########
# agent #

# You must fill in at least the following fields:
#
#	- name:		the name of your agent (for example, the executable
#			file name of your agent)
#
#	- subtrees:	the list of OIDs / subtrees of OIDs your agent
#			supports. The listed items must be separated by
#			a coma.
#
#	- port:		the UDP port number on which you will start
#			your agent
#
# You can also change the following fields:
#
#	- timeout:	the number of micro-seconds the SNMP Relay will
#			wait for a reponse from your agent
