steps to create the sample agent using the agent toolkit.

Step 1 : Create your MIB
Step 2 : Copy the files in the sample directory to your own directory
	 where you want to create your sub agent.
Step 3 : Copy your MIB file in this directory.
Step 4 : Modify the Makefile. Look for AGENT and assign the name of
	 your sub agent.
Step 5 : Modify the MIBS entry in the Makefile. You can replace mib_demo.txt
	 with your mib file name(e.g mymib.txt).
Step 6 : Type "make parse" to invoke the mibcodegen executable with
	 the required mib files. This will create multiple 'c' code files.
Step 7 : Modify the SOURCES entry in the Makefile. Add the 'c' files
	 which are created in the previous step.
Step 8 : Type "make", the sample agent executable will be created
Step 9 : Modify the various generated 'c' files to add the functionality that
	 the sub agent need to provide.

Remark:
Usage: snmpdemod  /* the generated subagent executable */
	[-h] /* help message */

	[-k (don't read config file)] /* run the subagent as standalone, in
				other words, it doesn't register with master
				agent */

	[-p port ] /* port for listening SNMP requests */

	[-c config-file (default /etc/opt/SUNWconn/SSA/snmp/conf/snmpdemo.reg)]
		/* file for oid(subtrees) registration with master agent.
		   with -k option, this file won't be read */

	[-a sec-config-file (default /etc/opt/SUNWconn/SSA/snmp/conf/snmpdemo.acl)]
		/* access control file for the subagent */

	[-i poll-interval (default 30 seconds)]
		/* maximum interval for subagent to wait for requests */

	[-d trace-level (range 0..4, default 0)]
		/* debugging purpose */
