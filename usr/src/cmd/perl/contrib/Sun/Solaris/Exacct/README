Licensing
---------
This module is released under the Perl Artistic License.

Availability
------------
This module is only available for Solaris 9 onwards.

Description
-----------
This module provided access to the Solaris Extended Accounting (exacct)
subsystem, which is part of the Solaris resource management infrastructure.

For more information on Solaris Extended Accounting, see the libexacct(3LIB)
and acctadm(1M) manpages and the following on-line documentation:

System Administration Guide: Resource Management and Network Services
Chapter 7 - Extended Accounting
http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-7125, or any later version

An example of how this module might be used is to dump the contents of an
exacct data file:

use Sun::Solaris::Exacct qw(:EXACCT_ALL);
die("Usage is dumpexacct <exacct file>\n") unless (@ARGV == 1);
my $ef = ea_new_file($ARGV[0], &O_RDONLY) || die(ea_error_str());
printf("Creator:  %s\n", $ef->creator());
printf("Hostname: %s\n\n", $ef->hostname());
while (my $obj = $ef->get()) {
        ea_dump_object($obj);
}
if (ea_error() != EXR_OK && ea_error() != EXR_EOF)  {
        printf("\nERROR: %s\n", ea_error_str());
        exit(1);
}
exit(0);
