SUNWonmdb - modular debugger development package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SUNWonmdb package is an internal development package containing the most
recent copy of MDB and the associated debugger modules.  The intent of this
package is to provide early access to new features and bug fixes as a package
that can be installed locally, or accessed from mdb.eng.

Information about MDB and using MDB on the SWAN can be found at:
    http://mdb.eng/

Comments and questions can be addressed to:
    Mike Shapiro (mws@eng.sun.com)

Contents of package:

    /opt/SUNWonmdb/bin/mdb
        This is a copy of the MDB wrapper script, which is installed as
        /net/mdb.eng/bin/mdb and in the gate's public/bin directory.
        The wrapper script is needed to point MDB at the module archives for
        older OS builds.  If the CODEMGR_WS environment variable is set and
        the proto area of the corresponding workspace contains an MDB binary,
        the script will execute that MDB binary; by default the binary on
        the local machine is executed.

    /opt/SUNWonmdb/bin/mkmodules
        The mkmodules script is used to build the MDB modules present in an
        MDB workspace against the set of include files saved in an MDB "root",
        created with the mkroot script.  The compiled modules are then
        installed into the root so that it can be used as an argument to
        the ``mdb -R'' option.

    /opt/SUNWonmdb/bin/mkroot
        The mkroot script populates an MDB "root" from a given set of BFU
        archives.  The root is created relative to the current directory.
        Relevant shared libraries, adb(1) macros, and include files are
        extracted by the script.

    /usr/bin/mdb
        The latest copy of MDB itself is installed into the appropriate
        ISA subdirectories of /usr/bin, and /usr/bin/mdb is created as a
        link to /usr/lib/isaexec.

    /usr/lib/mdb
    /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/mdb
        The MDB modules for the most recent ON build are installed into
        /usr/lib/mdb and platform library subdirectories as appropriate.

    /usr/lib/libproc.so
        The latest copy of libproc.so is also installed on the system as
        part of this package.  MDB uses libproc to control and examine
        processes and user core files.
