# "general" is intended to be a generic way to invoke a filesystem-specific
# command, but at the moment, only /usr/sbin/unshare uses this facility.
# Until someone else needs this functionality, this will be turned off
# so that we don't wind up with a spurious /usr/sbin/general.  To use
# "general" more fully in future, remove the comments from the lines below.
