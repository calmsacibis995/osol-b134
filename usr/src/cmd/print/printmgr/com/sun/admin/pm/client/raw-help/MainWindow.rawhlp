<b> List of Printers: </b> This is the list of printers installed on
the computer on which you are running Solaris Print Manager, or, if a
naming service is being used, all printers in the naming service.

<p>
There are three columns in the list:
<p> 

<b> Printer Name:</b> The name of the printer as specified during printer
installation. 
<p>

<b> Printer Server:</b> The name of the printer server for the printer
specified in the Printer Name column. 
<p>

<b> Description:</b> A description of the printer as specified during
printer installation (New Attached Printer or New Network
Printer) or modification (Modify Printer Properties). The
description might include the location of the printer and its printer
type.

<p> 

The footer panel at the bottom of the window has two or three entries:

<p> 

<b> Default Printer: </b> If no naming service is being used, the
default printer for the computer on which you are running Solaris
Print Manager. If a naming service is being used, the default printer
for the naming service.

<p>

<b> Naming Service: </b> The naming service -- NIS or LDAP --
that is being used for printing. This is not displayed if no naming
service is being used.

<p>

<b> Domain or Host: </b> The network domain you are working in or the
current host (if no naming service is being used). If you are
using a naming service, the list of printers includes all printers in
this domain.
