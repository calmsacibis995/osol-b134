<p>

If the NIS naming service is being used, you will need to know the
password for the naming service master. If LDAP is being used then
a fully distinguished name with update privilege and password will
be required. Note that default values may need to be overridden. 
See the man page for lpadmin(1M) and the help articles, "About 
Naming Services" and "NIS Authentication," for further information.
