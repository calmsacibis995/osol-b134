<CONTENT>

<p>

If you are using the NIS naming service, you will need the root
password for the NIS master computer to make any changes. The NIS
Authentication dialog is displayed when you select NIS as the
naming service.

<p>

1. Enter the password for the NIS master.

<p>

2. Click OK.

<p>

The entries you have made will be saved and the NIS Authentication
dialog will be dismissed. 

<p> 

Click Cancel if you don't know the password for the NIS master. 

<p>

<b>Note:</b> Keep the following in mind if you are using Solaris Print
Manager to update printer information in the NIS name service:

<p>

- If your network is set up with NIS master and slave servers, 
the NIS slaves may not see the updated printer information 
until the NIS slaves are updated. See ypmake(1M) for more
information.

<p>
	
- If your NIS servers are running Solaris 2.5 and compatible 
versions, you must have explicit permissions on the NIS master 
server to update the maps. This means an entry for your system 
name must reside in root's .rhosts file on the NIS master server.

<p>

- If you have modified the yp makefile to use something other
than /etc/printers.conf as the source for the NIS map,
printers.conf.byname, do not use Solaris Print Manager to modify NIS.
