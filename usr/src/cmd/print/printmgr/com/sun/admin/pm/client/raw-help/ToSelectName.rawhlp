<p>

Do the following to select a naming service for Solaris Print Manager or
to change from using a naming service to using no naming service. 

<p> 

When you select a naming service you are specifying where Solaris
Print Manager will retrieve printer information from, and where
changes made in Print Manager will be made. If a naming service is
selected, additions and deletions will be made in the printing
configuration database for the selected naming service. If you choose
"files," the /etc/printers.conf file will be used to determine which
printers are available, and changes will be made there.

<p>

1. Choose Select Naming Service from the Print Manager menu.

<p>

A dialog is displayed, asking you to choose a naming service. 

<p>

2. Choose a naming service (or "files," if no naming service is to be
used) and click OK.

<p>

The Solaris Print Manager main window is displayed, listing all the
accessible printers, which includes all printers in the selected
naming service's printer configuration database. 


<p>

See the man page for printers.conf(4) for more information.
