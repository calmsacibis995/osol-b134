<p>

Use the New Network Printer dialog to install a network printer,
thus making the printer available for printing from the network.

<p>

<b> Printer Name:</b>
    Specifies a unique name for the printer. The
    printer name must be a text string composed of
    uppercase or lowercase alphabetical characters
    (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens, or
    underscores. A printer name can be a maximum of
    14 characters long. 
<p> 

<b> Printer Server:</b> This is the computer you have selected to act
as the server for print actions. You must be logged on to this
computer and be running Solaris Print Manager on it.  Solaris Print
Manager sets up this system with the appropriate software to manage
local and remote printers.

<p> 
<b> Description:</b> 
    [Optional] Describes the printer, including the printer type and 
    location, possibly, or provides other information about the
    printer. 

<p> 

<b> Printer Make:</b> 
    Specifies the printer make, or manufacturer. This
    information is on the printer and/or in the documentation
    that is delivered with the printer.
<p>

<b> Printer Model:</b> 
    Specifies the printer model. This information
    is found on the printer and/or in the documentation that is
    delivered with the printer.

<p>

<b> Printer Driver:</b>
    Specifies the printer driver to use with this printer.  The label
    name followed in parentheses by one of the following letters
representing the repository in which the printer driver information resides:
U (user supplied printer information), A (administrator supplied printer
information), V (vendor supplied printer information), or S (system supplied
printer information), precedes the name of the Printer Driver.
<p>


<b> Fault Notification:</b> 
    Specifies how the superuser will be notified in
    case of a printer error.

<p> 
<b> Destination:</b>
<br>
For <b>BSD</b> Protocol, the network name of the printer followed by a colon
and the printer-vendor-supplied queue name.
<br>
For <b>TCP</b> Protocol, the network name of the printer followed by a colon
and the tcp port number to connect to.
<br>
For <b>URI</b> Protocol, a printer URI to be used in connecting to the remote
printer.  For example: "smb://user@printer-host/printer-name".
<p>

<b> Protocol:</b>
The internet protocol for file transfer; choices are BSD, TCP, or URI.
<p>

<b> Options: Default Printer:</b> If checked, this printer is
designated as the default printer for printing jobs sent to this
server. If another printer had been designated as the default printer
for the network, this printer will replace it as the default. If you
are using a naming service, this printer will be the default printer
for the naming service, also.

<p> Note that this is the last place the print subsystem looks to
determine where a particular print job will be printed; the
destination option of the lp command is the first place looked, and
other environment variables are checked before this one. See the man
page for printers.conf(4) for a full explanation of the search order.

<p>

<b> Options: Banner:</b> Specifies whether a banner 
page will be printed between jobs. 
<br>
<br>
"Aways Print Banner" stipulates that a banner will always be printed 
and may not be turned off by the user. 
<br>
"User Selectable - Default=on" stipulates that a banner will be printed 
unless the user selects 
to turn the banner off.  
<br>
"Never Print Banner" stipulates that a banner will never be printed 
and may not be turned on by the user.

<p>

<p>

<b> User Access List:</b> 
Specifies the print clients that can
    print to this printer. By default, all print
    clients have access to this printer, as designated by the word
"all" in the list. 
<p>

To add a user to the list, type a user name in the blank text field
below the list and click Add. Note that this user name replaces "all"
or "none" if either "all" or "none" is in the user access list. If
"all" or "none" is added as a user, "all" or "none" will replace the
names in the list.

<p>

To delete a user from the list, select the user in the list and click
Delete. 

<p>

<b>OK:</b> Apply changes and dismiss the window.
<br>
<b>Apply:</b> Apply the changes and leave the window displayed.
<br>
<b>Reset:</b> Reset all fields to last Apply
<br>
<b>Cancel:</b> Dismiss the window.
<br>
<b>Help:</b> Display help for the current window or dialog.
