<p>

Do the following to modify the properties of an installed printer.

<p> 

1. Double-click the printer in the Solaris Print Manager main window
<p> 
   OR
<p> 
   Select the printer in the Solaris Print Manager main window and choose
   Modify Printer Properties from the Printer menu. 
<p> 
   The Modify Printer Properties dialog is displayed. 

<p> 
2. Modify the printer configuration, as needed.
<p> 

If this is an attached printer (one installed on the computer on which
you are running Solaris Print Manager) you can modify the Description,
Printer Port, Printer Type, File Contents, Fault Notification,
Options, and User Access List.

<p>

If this is not an attached printer, only the Description field can be
modified. You can also check or uncheck the Default Printer box. 

<p> 
3. Click OK.
<p> 

The changes you made are saved and the Modify Printer Properties
dialog is dismissed.

<p> 

   If you modified the Description field, the new description is
displayed in the Solaris Print Manager main window.

<p> 

<b> Note:</b> If you are using the NIS naming service, you have to know
the root password for the NIS master. If you are using the LDAP naming service,
you must know a fully distinguished name which has update privilege and
the corresponding password. Default values may need to be overridden.
You will be prompted for the password when you select the NIS or
LDAP naming service. Enter the password and click OK.

<p> 

<b> Note:</b> To modify the Printer Name or Printer Server field,
delete the printer and add it with a new printer and/or server name.

<p>

<b>OK:</b> Apply changes and dismiss the window.
<br>
<b>Apply:</b> Apply the changes and leave the window displayed.
<br>
<b>Reset:</b> Reset all fields to last Apply
