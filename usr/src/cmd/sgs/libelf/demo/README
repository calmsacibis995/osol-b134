This directory contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
use the libelf library.  Manual pages for libelf routines are
located in section 3e: Library Functions.

Each of these sample programs displays or manipulates information
from a ELF file in some way.  Each programs also uses libelf
differently.  To learn more about ELF files and their format you
should refer to the "Linker & Libraries section" of the Solaris
AnswerBook and to the "System V Application Binary Interface"
printed by Unix Press.

The following is an overview of the source files provided:

pcom.c		print comment: prints the .comment section of ELF
		files ELF members of archives. Demonstrates how to
		examine a file opened with elf_begin(ELF_C_READ)

acom.c		append comment: appends to or creates a .comment
		section for ELF files.  Demonstrates the updating
		of a file with elf_begin(ELF_C_RDWR)

dcom.c		delete comment: deletes a .comment section from an
		ELF file.  Demonstrates the creation of a ELF
		file with elf_begin(ELF_C_WRITE)

tpcom.c		threaded print comment:  a threaded version of pcom.c.
		Demonstrates that libelf is MT-Hot and can be used
		in a threaded program.

dispsyms.c	print symbols:  scans a ELF file for any symbol tables
		(SHT_SYMTAB, SHT_DYNSYM, or SHT_SUNW_LDYNSYM) and
		displays the symbol tables contents.

Makefile	make file to build the above programs.



Building the demos
------------------

Before attempting to build the demos be sure that you have installed a
Solaris Developer Cluster and a C compiler (purchased separatly) onto
your system.

To build the programs, do the following:

	% make all

To test the programs, do the following:

	% make test
