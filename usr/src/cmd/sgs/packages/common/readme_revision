# Generate a revision number for the sgs linker components, based
# on usr/src/cmd/sgs/packages/common/SUNWonld-README.
#
#	usage: readme_revision [-d] [readme-file]
#
# This revision number used to be the SCCS revision id for that file,
# in the form 1.xxx (where xxx was the revision). There were two benefits:
#
#	(1) You could examine the sccs revision log to determine the CR
#		of the putback that created the revision.
#	(2) The revisions were monotonically increasing.
#
# In order to remove the hard wired dependence on sccs, this script generates
# a replacement revision number, by returning the string '1.xxx', where
# xxx is an integer giving the number of unique CR lines found in the file.
# This means that the revision goes up by one for each CR we fix, which
# makes intutive sense, and is similar to the way the SCCS revision worked.
#
# If this is a debug/development build (-d option), then we include
# additional information at the end of the revision:
#
#	- Workspace name
#	- user
#	- CR # of last item in the readme file
#	- date,
#
# This extra information is useful when we need to identify SUNWonld
# linker packages in the field, and provides the information previously
# supplied by (1) above.
