# This admin file can be used to force the installation of the
# SUNWonld package on a system that already has it installed, without
# having to first uninstall the existing instance. This is a generally
# undesirable thing to do, but can be handy if you forget to uninstall
# SUNWonld before BFUing the system. In that state, removing the
# package can break your system, and the only safe route forward is
# to install on top of the existing package.
