This directory contains sample code on how to use the Link-Auditing
interface of the runtime linker (ld.so.1(1)).  The Link-Auditing interface
permits a user supplied shared object to audit objects that are loaded,
and symbols that are bound, by the runtime linker.  A full description
of the Link-Auditing interface can be found in the 'Linker & Libraries
Guide' which is part of the Solaris AnswerBook.

The following is an overview of the directory structure and highlights
some of the important files contained within:

Makefile	- Makefile to build the Link-Auditing examples
src/*		- source code
man/*		- Man pages for the examples

To build these examples, copy this directory structure to a directory
where you have write permissions.  Then type 'make'.
