or derived work) in any form, or on any medium, is permitted only if all the
following conditions are met:

1. Redistributions qualify as "freeware" or "Open Source Software" under
   the following terms:

     a. Redistributions are made at no charge beyond the reasonable cost
        of materials and delivery.  Where redistribution of this software
        is as part of a larger package or combined work, this restriction
        applies only to the costs of materials and delivery of this
        software, not to any other costs associated with the larger package
        or combined work.

     b. Redistributions are accompanied by a copy of the Source Code or by
        an irrevocable offer to provide a copy of the Source Code for up
        to three years at the cost of materials and delivery. Such
        redistributions must allow further use, modification, and
        redistribution of the Source Code under substantially the same
        terms as this license. For the purposes of redistribution "Source
        Code" means all files included in the original distribution,
        including all modifications or additions, on a medium and in a
        form allowing fully working executable programs to be produced.

2. Redistributions of Source Code must retain the copyright notices as
   they appear in each Source Code file and the COPYRIGHT file, these
   license terms, and the disclaimer/limitation of liability set forth as
   paragraph 6 below.

   these license terms, and the disclaimer/limitation of liability set
   forth as paragraph 6 below, in the documentation and/or other materials
   provided with the distribution. For the purposes of binary distribution
   the "Copyright Notice" refers to the following language:
