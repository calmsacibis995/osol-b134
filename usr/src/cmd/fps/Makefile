# Note that the compilation of fptest is handled differently.
# If the primary compiler is not a Sun Studio compiler, fptest will
# *not* be compiled. This is because fptest is dependent on some Sun
# performance libraries provided as part of the Sun Studio compiler
# installation. fptest statically links libsunperf.a, libfui.a,
# libfai.a, libfsu.a, and libsunmath.a. The other SUBDIRS will be
# compiled.
#
# If the make macro __GNUC is "#", it means Sun Studio compiler is being
# used for the compilation.
