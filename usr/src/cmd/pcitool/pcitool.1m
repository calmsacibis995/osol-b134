.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
PCItool is a low-level tool which provides a facility for getting and setting
interrupt routing information.

.SS \fIInterrupt Routing\fR

The \fIpcitool -i\fR command displays device and CPU routing information for
INOs on a given nexus, and allows rerouting of a given INO or INO group to a
specific CPU. Use the \fIpcitool -m\fR command to retrieve and reroute MSI/Xs.
  
On SPARC platforms, the INO is mapped to an interrupt mondo, where as one or
more MSI/Xs are mapped to an INO. So, INO and MSI/Xs are individually
retargetable. Use "-i" option to retrieve or reroute a given INO, where as
use "-m" option for MSI/Xs.
   
On x86 platforms, both INOs and MSI/Xs are mapped to the same interrupt vectors.
Use "-i" option to retrieve and reroute any interrupt vectors (both INO and
MSI/Xs).  So, "-m" option is not required on x86 platforms. Hence it is not
supported.

\fIRequired privileges\fR

The user must have all privileges in order to access interrupt
information.  A regular user can access interrupt information when
\fBsu\fR(1M) to root or granted the "Maintenance and Repair" rights
profile in the \fBuser_attr\fR file. See \fBuser_attr\fR(4) and
\fBrbac\fR(5).


\fICommandline options\fR

-r [ -c ]

Display device and CPU routing information for INOs on a given nexus.
The device path and instance number of each device for each displayed INO will
be shown.  On some platforms, interrupts dedicated to the root complex are
indicated with "(Internal)" appended to their pathname.

Dump interrupt controller information with -c.

If neither -r nor -w are provided on the commandline, -r is assumed.

The command for showing all INOs on /pci@1e,600000 is:
   
  # pcitool /pci@1e,600000 -i all
   
The command for showing ino 0x19 on  the  same  root  nexus, along with sample
output, is:
   
  # pcitool /pci@1e,600000 -i 19
   
  ino 19 mapped to cpu 0
  Device: /pci@1e,600000/pci@0/pci@9/pci@0/scsi@1
    Driver: mpt, instance 0
   
  ino 19 mapped to cpu 0
  Device: /pci@1e,600000/pci@0/pci@2/pci@0/network@4
    Driver: bge, instance 0
   
The command for showing MSI 0x1  on  the  same  root  nexus,
along with sample output, is:
   
# pcitool /pci@1e,600000 -m 1
   
  msi 1 mapped to cpu 0
  Device: /pci@1e,600000/pci@0/pci@9/pci@0/scsi@1
    Driver: mpt, instance 0

-w \fI<cpu#>\fR [ -g ]

Route the given INO or MSI/X to the given CPU. Display the  new and original
routing information. The INO or MSI/X must be specified.
  
Successful rerouting ino 19 above from cpu 0 to cpu 1 gives the following
output:
   
  # pcitool /pci@1e,600000 -i 19 -w 1
   
  Interrupts on ino 19 reassigned: Old cpu: 0, New cpu: 1
   
Successful rerouting msi 1 above from cpu 1 to cpu 0 gives the following
output:
  
  # pcitool /pci@1e,600000 -m 1 -w 0
  
  Interrupts on msi 1 reassigned: Old cpu: 1, New cpu: 0

On some platforms (such as X86) multiple MSI interrupts of a single function
need to be rerouted together.  Use -g to do this.  -g works only on supported
platforms  and only for groups of MSI interrupts.  (A "group" of 1 is accepted.)
When -g is used, the vector provided must be the lowest-numbered vector of the
group.  The size of the group is determined internally.

Successful rerouting a group of INOs starting at 60 from cpu 0 to cpu 1 gives
the following output:

  # pcitool /pci@0,0 -i 60 -w 1 -g

  Interrupts on ino group starting at ino 60 reassigned: Old cpu: 0, New cpu: 1

-v

Verbose output.

-q

No errors reported as messages.  Unix error status still returned by
program, however.
