# If we are now installing intrd on this system for the first
# time, we will need to call svcadm to enable the new service. We
# must not do this if intrd is already installed, as the user may
# have intentionally disabled it. Here we touch intrd.tmp as a
# way of telling our matching postinstall script that it should
# update /var/svc/profile/upgrade.
