#	Since packaging does not support pathnames with an embedded
#	equal sign in them, the PostScript definition file "~=" under
#	$BASEDIR/usr/lib/font/devpost/charlib is instead delivered via
#	the package under the name "~" and then an attempt is made to
#	link the latter to the former.
#

CHARLIB=$BASEDIR/usr/lib/font/devpost/charlib

#
# First attempt to remove the old version of the PostScript definition
# file.  In the case of a read-only file system (for example, during the
# installation of a Sparse Root zone), the pathname will still exist
# after the attempted removal so there is nothing left to do and the
# script can exit with success.  Otherwise, an attempt to link the
# packaged pathname to the desired pathname is made.
