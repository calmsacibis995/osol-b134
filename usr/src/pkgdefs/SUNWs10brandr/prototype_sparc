# The kernel brand module
# Normally, brand modules are delivered via /usr/kernel because they are not
# required for boot.  However, the solars10 brand syscall emulation module must
# be delivered via /platform on SPARC because it depends on platform-specific
# kernel data structures (specifically the machcpu_t) and we don't currently
# support loading platform-specific kernel modules from /usr/platform.
