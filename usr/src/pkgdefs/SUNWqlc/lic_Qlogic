3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make 
     available in Executable form must also be made available in Source 
     Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under 
     the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License 
     with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
     You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform 
     recipients of any such Covered Software in xecutable form as to 
     how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
     reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
     software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are 
     governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You 
     believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or 
     You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
     License.

3.3. Required Notices.

     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that 
     identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not 
     remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices 
     contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
     or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or 
     the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in 
     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version 
     of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may 
     choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of 
     Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
     and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You 
     must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, 
     indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
     hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every 
     Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
     such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 
     liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software 
     under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of 
     Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, 
     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License 
     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from 
     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the 
     Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You 
     must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from 
     this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial 
     Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred 
     by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any 
     such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with 
     other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
     distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, 
     You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
     for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.

     Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may 
     publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to 
     time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 
     Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license 
     steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the 
     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the 
     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. 
     If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original 
     Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made 
     available under any subsequent version of the License, You must 
     distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms 
     of the version of the License under which You originally received 
     the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
     distribute or otherwise make the 
     Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent 
     version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new 
     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a 
     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license 
     and remove any references to the name of the license steward
     (except to note that the license differs from this License); and 
     (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which 
     differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" 
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED 
   SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
   PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
   PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY 
   COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
   INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY 
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF 
   WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. 
   NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT 
   UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to 
     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. 
     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond 
     the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory 
     judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the 
     Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such 
     claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the 
     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the 
     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the 
     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly 
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if 
     the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors 
     under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate 
     prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day 
     notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw 
     Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such 
     Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement 
     with Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant 
     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly 
     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by 
     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be 
     taken into account in determining the amount or value of any 
     payment or license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all 
     end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any 
     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses 
     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE 
   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF 
   COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE 
   LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER 
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR 
   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE 
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL 
   NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM 
   SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS 
   SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS 
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined 
   in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer 
   software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. " 252.227-7014(a)
   (1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms 
   are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 
   12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
   U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those 
   rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in 
   lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or 
   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software 
   under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject 
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
   necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by 
   the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
   the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, 
   provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law 
   provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject 
   to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and 
   venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, 
   with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without 
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. 
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for 
   the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or 
   regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You 
   agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United 
   States export administration regulations (and the export control 
   laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
   or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is 
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, 
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
   work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 
   responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
