# Recall that in SUNWcsr's pkginfo.tmpl, the driver_aliases class-action
# script is invoked *after* this class-action script.  This is critical
# because if we are going to add_drv a new driver 'foo', and 'foo' has
# an alias 'bar', the add_drv of 'foo' will fail if the alias is already
# present.  Thus new aliases must be added *after* new driver major entries.
# The driver_aliases class-action script will add the complete set of aliases
# if we create an empty file here, so this code allows us to continue and
# get a correct upgrade in the face of a missing driver_aliases file.
