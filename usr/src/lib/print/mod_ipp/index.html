The Internet Print Protocol (IPP) requires that all protocol requests be
encapsulated in HTTP and that all HTTP protocol requests be POST requests with
a Content-Type of "application/ipp".  Since your request did not meet this
criteria, it has been ignored by the IPP listener.  You will be redirected to
the 
<a href=http://docs.sun.com/db?q=%22Internet+Print+Protocol%22&p=prod%2Fsolaris>

so that you can learn more about the Internet Print Protocol Listener.
