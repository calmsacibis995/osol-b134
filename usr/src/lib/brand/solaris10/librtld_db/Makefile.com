# ATTENTION:
#	Librtl_db brand plugin libraries should NOT directly invoke any
#	libproc.so interfaces or be linked against libproc.  If a librtl_db
#	brand plugin library uses libproc.so interfaces then it may break
#	any other librtld_db consumers (like mdb) that tries to attach
#	to a branded process.  The only safe interfaces that the a librtld_db
#	brand plugin library can use to access a target process are the
#	proc_service(3PROC) apis.
