	Historically, the deleted-device element denoted a used-to-be
	device element.  This was used to keep track of device elements
	deleted or modified by the user, and to cleanse /dev of such
	entries at next zone boot.

	With the ability to now configure devices dynamically, this
	requirement no longer exists, but this element MUST remain in
	perpetuity, since it is possible that an upgraded zone could
	carry a deleted-device element, and would therefore fail XML
	validation if removed
